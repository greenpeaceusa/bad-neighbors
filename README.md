# Background

This repository contains the data that informs the<i> Bad Neighbor: Energy Transfer’s Pattern of Pollution and Violations</i> report from Greenpeace USA. The report draws on publicly available data and government records of spills, leaks, violations, and penalties across Energy Transfer’s corporate network, including major subsidiary Sunoco. 

Energy Transfer (ET) has a complex corporate structure that has changed significantly over time. The latest <a href="https://ir.energytransfer.com/node/51496/html">10-K</a> for FY 2024 lists over 400 named subsidiaries and several joint ventures. We provide details on how we tracked and defined this corporate structure in the appendix of <i>Bad Neighbor</i>.
